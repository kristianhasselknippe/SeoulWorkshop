# Fuse Seoul Workshop

We will start the project from scratch during the workshop, but this is an example of the code we will be working towards.

It also contains the assets we will be using in the "Assets" folder.

We will be using a mock backend for this project which is in Backend.js. We will copy this file as well when we start our new project.
